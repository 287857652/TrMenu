### License

[LICENSE](https://github.com/TrMenu/TrMenu/blob/v2/LICENSE.md)

Despite TrMenu is a paid plugin, by any means,  
I will and cannot prevent you from downloading the artifacts  
or compiling it yourself as long as you do not distribute it

However, purchasing a license will support this project and its  
continual development. I will be appreciated and do the best of my ability  
to offer help to you as long as I am available.
